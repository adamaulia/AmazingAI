# Contribution Flow
The first thing you should do is of course to create an account and [install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your device.
After that, [clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) this project to the your own directory.

This repository development requires you to use [Branching WorkFlows](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branching-Workflows), in brief:

- Create your own branch from `master`
```
git checkout -b newFeatureBranch
```
- Commit your changes on your branch
```
git add .
git commit -m "gives your comment of your commit here"
```
- After all looks good, push your branch (don't forget to pull from `master` first before push)
```
git push -u origin newFeatureBranch
```
- Create Pull Request from your branch to master
- Wait reviewer to check your Pull Request and merge to the master
